# ImageWithLibCss

This library contains a scss-file with a CSS image. It will be published as an npm package and should be used by an Angular app.

## Build the library 

Simply run

    npm run build:lib

This will take care of building the lib and copying over the SCSS & assets. 

## Publish the library 

I used Verdaccio to publish the library locally and installed it in another project. (image-from-lib-css).

## Problem

The image is not loaded correctly.
